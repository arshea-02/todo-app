# To-do App
App is developed using JSX and React. The app allows a user to input a task, which is then listed in an unordered list. The task can be deleted from the list and can be marked as done(this part is not working properly).

The functional components that contain the main functionality of the app is in https://github.com/internArshea/todo-app/tree/master/to-do-app/src/components 

The concepts I learned while making this app are
- Functional Components and how to define and use them
- States and their importance
- How to render input
- Arrow Functions and their importance
- useState Hook and how to use it
- Array functions like filter() and map()
